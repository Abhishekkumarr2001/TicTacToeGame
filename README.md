# TicTacToeGame
The Tic Tac Toe game developed in Python is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. 
The objective of the game is to place three of your markers (X or O) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line to win the game.

The Python implementation of Tic Tac Toe utilizes a user-friendly command-line interface, allowing players to take turns and input their moves by selecting the desired position on the grid. 
The game includes error handling to prevent invalid moves and displays the updated grid after each turn.

Additional features may include:

Win detection to determine when a player has achieved a winning combination.
A tie condition to identify when the game ends in a draw.
Option for players to restart the game or exit after completion.
Visual enhancements such as ASCII art for the grid or colored markers.
The Tic Tac Toe game in Python showcases programming concepts such as data structures, conditional statements, loops, and user input handling, providing an enjoyable and interactive gaming experience for players.
